<p>Following the COCO dataset, we tag testing object instances as small, medium, and large according to their bounding box area. The following 14 metrics are used for characterizing the performance of an instance detector on InsDet dataset. Additionally, we will also evaluate AP on <i>easy</i> and <i>hard</i> scenes separately.</p>
